                    One career goal of mine is to one day become a independant
                    Brand Designer. I have a passion for Drawing and creating,
                    to have the opportunity to do if your a living is a dream.
               
               
                    Im originally from Hartford, CT but I have lived in Atlanta,Gallery
                    for the past 10 years. Prior to moving to georgia I was a scholarship
                    football player at the University of South Carolina. 
                    A random fact that most would not expect about me
