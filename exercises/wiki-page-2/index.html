            <b>Graphic design</b>is a 
            <a href="#">profession,</a>
            <sup>

                <a href="#">academic discipline</a>
            <sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and applied art whose activity consists in projecting
            visual communications intended to transmit specific messages
            to social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design
            is an interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine 
            arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral 
            hinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use 
            text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>
        <p>The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and 
            the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and
             imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
             language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
             customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
             linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that 
             graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
             manifestation.

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the aviation world
            <sup>[8]</sup> or space exploration.
            <sup>[9][10]</sup> 
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as 
            only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, 
            this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part 
            of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
            <sup>[11]</sup> graphic design 
            as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture 
            in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct
            profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the
            19th century
            <sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution allowed its consolidation in
            the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information 
            exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater 
            than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies
            and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the
            ompetence of the engineers who develop them.
