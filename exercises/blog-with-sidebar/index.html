                    On today's Pardon My Take... CLINTON PORTIS! The two-time Pro 
                    Bowler joined Mr. Cat and Mr. Commenter in our new Chicago 
                    studio to talk about his career, the 2001 Miami Hurricanes, 
                    running the football, the insane Miami track team and tons 
                    more.
                    A lot of the discussion around the football world this season 
                    has been about the usage and compensation of the running back 
                    position. Compared to 10 years ago and even in the 2000's, 
                    when Portis played, the approach of the RB position is much 
                    ifferent. You rarely see 3-down backs anymore, as most teams 
                    use a Running Back By Committee. On today's show, Portis explained 
                    what he has seen on the change of the RB position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember 5-10 years ago, when the RB was the most prestigious 
                    position in Fantasy Football? Now, the top of big boaards have 
                    seemingly flipped, with guys like Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, 
                    and Tyreek Hill going at the beginning of drafts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running Backs are still super important, don't get me wrong, 
                    but all of what Clinton Portis said on today's show is true. 
                    All teams handle the usage of each RB much differently than 
                    when he played, so it is hard for guys to get in a true rhythm 
                    in the backfield.

                    This was an awesome interview that I highly recommend listening 
                    to in its entirety!
