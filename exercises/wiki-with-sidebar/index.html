                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying 
                    degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word 
                    football normally means the form of football that is the most 
                    popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football 
                    include association football (known as soccer in North America, 
                    Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American 
                    football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby 
                    union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various 
                    forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins 
                    and are known as "football codes".
                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or 
                    prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the 
                    world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced 
                    back to the codification of these games at English public schools 
                    during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural 
                    influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football 
                    to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly 
                    controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct 
                    regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for 
                    example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional 
                    football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, 
                    The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first 
                    of many professional football associations. During the 20th 
                    century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become 
                    some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]

                    The various codes of football share certain common elements and can 
                    be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like 
                    American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby 
                    union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field 
                    while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such 
                    as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is 
                    moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly 
                    limited.Common rules among the sports include.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some 
                            variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) 
                            are also popular.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing 
                            team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or 
                            over a line..
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball 
                            between two goalposts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
                            Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. 
                            no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion 
                    of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes, there are 
                    rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players 
                    scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar 
                    between the goalposts.

                <p>
                    The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern 
                    association football.[14] It existed during the Han dynasty 
                    and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries 
                    BC, attested by descriptions in a military manual.[15][16] The 
                    Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during t
                    he Asuka period.[17] This is known to have been played within the 
                    Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, 
                    several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, 
                    trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie 
                    uppie).The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many 
                    ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman 
                    game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team 
                    game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[18][19] or "φαινίνδα" (
                    phaininda),[20] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, 
                    Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian 
                    theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These 
                    games appear to have resembled rugby football.[21][22][23][24]
                    [25] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the 
                    case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball 
                    was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew
                    the air-filled ball, the follis.[26][27] Episkyros is described 
                    as an early form of football by FIFA.[28]

                <hr>
                <h3>English public schools</h3>
                <p>
                    While football continued to be played in various forms throughout 
                    Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other 
                    countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the
                     creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence 
                     suggests that they were important in taking football away from 
                     its "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport. 
                     Second, many early descriptions of football and references to 
                     it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. 
                     Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these 
                     schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to 
                     be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public 
                     schools that the division between "kicking" and "running" (or 
                     "carrying") games first became clear.

                    The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being 
                    played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from 
                    the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the 
                    Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at 
                    Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a 
                    translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball 
                    full of wynde".[51]

                    Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th 
                    century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been 
                    described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football
                    ".[52] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of 
                    organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams 
                    ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), a referee 
                    ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)". 
                    Mulcaster's "footeball" had evolved from the disordered and 
                    violent forms of traditional football:[s]ome smaller number with 
                    such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not 
                    meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: 
                    nor shouldring or s people in Britain had to work six days a week, 
                    often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor 
                    the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the 
                    time, many children were part of the labour force. Feast day 
                    football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, 
                    who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of 
                    organised football games with formal codes of rules.
