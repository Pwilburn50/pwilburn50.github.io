                <p>
                    The most common story around Christmas observation was 
                    when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was told that she will 
                    be having a special child from the Lord. It is said that 
                    Mother Mary got this prediction on March 25 and nine months 
                    later on December 25 Jesus was born.

                    a pagan religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the 
                    end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear 
                    costumes to ward off ghosts.
